# Problem Statement

## 🌱 Background

Excessive and indiscriminate use of pesticides in agriculture is a major issue in India and worldwide. Farmers often spray pesticides uniformly across entire fields without considering whether a plant is healthy or infected. This leads to:

* Wastage of chemicals and increased farming costs.
* Soil degradation and water contamination.
* Harm to pollinators and other beneficial insects.
* Health risks for humans and animals due to pesticide residues.

Manual inspection of crops is labor-intensive, error-prone, and not scalable, especially for small farmers who lack access to precision agriculture tools. There is a pressing need for **cost-effective, intelligent spraying systems** that can detect plant health conditions and apply pesticides only where necessary.

## 🚩 Problem Definition

How can we design and implement a **smart pesticide spraying system** that:

* Detects infection levels in plants using **camera vision + ML algorithms**.
* Decides in real time **whether spraying is needed or not**.
* Sprays **precisely and selectively** to minimize chemical usage.
* Reduces environmental hazards while improving crop yield.

## 🎯 Goals

* Build a **rover-based spraying system** equipped with:

  * Camera + sensors to capture plant health data.
  * ML pipeline to detect disease/infection levels.
  * Robotic arm with **3-axis movement** carrying sprayer + camera.
  * Controlled pesticide spray mechanism with **DC pump & nozzles**.
* Integrate decision-making into rover navigation (spray or move forward).
* Provide a **farmer-friendly web interface** for system monitoring and data visualization.

## 🌍 Impact

* **Farmers** → lower costs, improved yields, reduced labor.
* **Environment** → reduced pesticide runoff and contamination.
* **Consumers** → safer, residue-free food.
* **Sustainability** → promotes precision farming and resource efficiency.
